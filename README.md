Gossip Simulator
================

Gossip type algorithms can be used both for group communication and for aggregate computation. The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of such algorithms through a simulator based on actors written in Scala. Since actors in Scala are fully asynchronous, the particular type of Gossip implemented is the so called Asynchronous Gossip.

How to run the program can be found in the Project Requirement file.
